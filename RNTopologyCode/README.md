# Topological Analysis of Bitcoin's Lightning Network

## Pre-print is available on [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.04972).

This repo contains a simple tool to analyze LN's graph and its topological properties, furthermore we include the accompanying paper summarizing our findings and suggestions to improve LN's robustness against targeted attacks.

If you are eager to integrate some of the analysis to your LN explorer, please let me know. I would be glad to help you in doing that.
